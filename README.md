# YoutubeParty

# Requirements
You should have Docker installed and configured correctly (i.e. creating and connecting to machines functions correctly)

# Building/Deploying
`deploy.sh` should build and deploy YoutubeParty for you. To access/verify that it is running, you can check [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (the web app) or [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) (adminer page). If you installed Docker using Docker Toolbox for Windows, note that you will have to replace `localhost` with the IP address of the VirtualBox machine (e.g. `192.168.99.100`)
